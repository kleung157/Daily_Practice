Question:
Another One - Spotify Python Interview Question
We're trying to create a digital clone of DJ Khaled. No fancy AI or alorithms needed.
Just take a number and add another one:
More specifically, you are given an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of positive whole number. 
It is ordered from most significant to least significant digit.
Return an array of digits of the number after adding another one to the input.
Example #1
Input: digits = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 4]
Example #2
Input: digits = [6, 9]
Output: [7, 0]

Data Dictionary:
Table name = ''
N/A

Code:
Solution #1
def another_one(digits):
    i = len(digits) - 1
    while i >= 0 and digits[i] == 9:
        digits[i] = 0
        i -= 1
    if i >= 0:
        digits[i] += 1
        return digits
    else:
        return [1] + digits

weight: bigint(int)

Code:
Solution #1
/* SELECT to preview data */
SELECT * FROM amazon_shipment;

/* Total weight for each shipment_id */
SELECT
    shipment_date,

Question:
Meta - Users with Many Searches
Count the number of users who made more than 5 searches in August 2021.

Data Dictionary:
Table name = 'fb_searches'
age_group: text(str)
date: date(str)
search_id: bigint(int)
search_query: text(str)
user_id: (bigint)

Code:
/* SELECT to preview data */
SELECT * FROM fb_searches;

/* Count of users with > 5 searches in Aug 2021 */
SELECT
    user_id,
    COUNT(search_query)
FROM fb_searches
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) = '2021'
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) = '8'
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(search_query) > 5;

/* CTE for exact count */
WITH num_searches AS (
    SELECT
       user_id,
       COUNT(search_query)
    FROM fb_searches
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) = '2021'
       AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) = '8'
    GROUP BY 1
    HAVING COUNT(search_query) > 5
)
SELECT
    COUNT(user_id) AS total_users
FROM num_searches;

Solution #2:
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS num_users_more_than_5_searches
FROM
    fb_searches
WHERE
    date >= '2021-08-01' AND date <= '2021-08-31'
