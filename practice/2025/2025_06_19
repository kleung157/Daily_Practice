Question:
Meta - Users Activity Per Month Day
Return the total number of posts made on each calendar day of the month, aggregated across all months and years (ignoring user and year).

Data Dictionary:
Table name = 'facebook_posts'
post_id: int64(int)
poster: int64(int)
post_text: object(str)
post_keywords: object(str)
post_date: datetime64(dt)

Code:
Solution #1 (using copy(), groupby(), size(), reset_index(), dt.day)
# Question: Return total number of posts made on each calendar day of the month,
# aggregated across all months and years (ignoring user and year)
# Output: total_post

# Import libraries
import pandas as pd

# Preview data
data = facebook_posts.copy()
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
#df.head(10)

# Extract day of month
df['day_of_month'] = df['post_date'].dt.day

# Group by day of month and count posts
post_per_day_df = df.groupby('day_of_month').size().reset_index(name='total_posts')

# Final iteration
post_per_day_df

# Check solution
#print(df[['day_of_month', 'post_id']].sort_values(by='day_of_month', ascending=True))
