Question:
Tweets' Rolling Averages - Twitter SQL Interview Question
Given a table of tweet data over a specified time period, calculate the 3-day rolling average of tweets for each user. Output the user ID, tweet date, and rolling averages rounded to 2 decimal places.
Notes:
A rolling average, also known as a moving average or running mean is a time-series technique that examines trends in data over a specified period of time.
In this case, we want to determine how the tweet count for each user changes over a 3-day period.

Data Dictionary:
Table name = 'tweets'
user_id: integer(int)
tweet_date: timestamp(str)
tweet_count: integer(int)

Code:
Solution #1(For 3-day rolling average use ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
/* SELECT to preview data */
SELECT * FROM tweets;

/* 3-day rolling average of tweets for each user */
/* How tweet count for each user changes over a 3-day period */
/* Output: user_id, tweet_date, rolling_avg_3d(round to 2 decimal) */
SELECT
    user_id,
    tweet_date,
    tweet_count,
    ROUND(
        AVG(tweet_count) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY tweet_date)
        , 2) AS rolling_avg_3d
FROM tweets;

/* Final iteration */
SELECT
    user_id,
    tweet_date,
    ROUND(AVG(tweet_count) OVER(
        PARTITION BY user_id
        ORDER BY tweet_date
        ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ), 2) AS rolling_avg_3d
FROM tweets;

Question:
Consecutive Fives - Akuna Capital Statistics Interview Question
Say youâ€™re rolling a fair six-sided die. 
What is the expected number of rolls until you get two consecutive 5s?

Data Dictionary:
Table name = ''
N/A

Code:
Solution #1
Fair 6-sided die.

- Probability of a 5: 1/6
- Probability of not a 5: 5/6
- Probability of two consecutive 5's: 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36
- Probability of not two consecutive 5's: 5/6 * 5/6 = 25/36

Expected number of rolls for two consecutive 5s.

For roll_1:
- roll_1 = 1/6(1 + roll_2) + 5/6(1 + roll_1)
- roll_1 = 1/6 + 1/6(roll_2) + 5/6 + 5/6(roll_1)
- roll_1 * 6 = (1 + 1/6(roll_2) + 5/6(roll_1) ) * 6
- 6(roll_1) = 6 + roll_2 + 5(roll_1)
- roll_1 = 6 + roll_2

For roll_2:
- roll_2 = 1/6(1 + 0) + 5/6(1 + roll_1)
- roll_2 = 1/6 + 0 + 5/6 + 5/6(roll_1)
- roll_2 = 1 + 5/6(roll_1)

For roll_1 and roll_2 equations:
- roll_1 = 6 + roll_2
- roll_2 = 1 + 5/6(roll_1)

Combine equations to solve for number of rolls for two consecutive 5s:
- roll_1 = 6 + (1 + 5/6(roll_1))
- roll_1 = 6 + 1 + 5/6(roll_1)
- roll_1 = 7 + 5/6(roll_1)
- 6/6(roll_1) - 5/6(roll_1) = 7
- 6 * (1/6(roll_1)) = 7 * 6
- roll_1 = 42 rolls

Practice:
(Three consecutive 5s)
For roll_1:
- roll_1 = 1/6(1 + roll_2) + 5/6(1 + roll_1)
- roll_1 = 1/6 + 1/6(roll_2) + 5/6 + 5/6(roll_1)
- roll_1 = 1 + 1/6(roll_2) + 5/6(roll_1)
- roll_1 = 6 + roll_2
For roll_2:
- roll_2 = 1/6(1 + roll_3) + 5/6(1 + roll_1)
- roll_2 = 1/6 + 1/6(roll_3) + 5/6 + 5/6(roll_1)
- roll_2 = 1 + 1/6(roll_3) + 5/6(roll_1)
For roll_3:
- roll_3 = 1/6(1 + 0) + 5/6(1 + roll_1)
- roll_3 = 1/6 + 0 + 5/6 + 5/6(roll_1)
- roll_3 = 1 + 5/6(roll_1)
Equations:
1. roll_1 = 1 + 1/6(roll_2) + 5/6(roll_1) OR - roll_1 = 6 + roll_2
2. roll_2 = 1 + 1/6(roll_3) + 5/6(roll_1)
3. roll_3 = 1 + 5/6(roll_1)
Combine equations 2 and 3:
- roll_2 = 1 + 1/6(1 + 5/6(roll_1) + 5/6(roll_1)
- roll_2 = 1 + 1/6 + 5/36(roll_1) + 5/6(roll_1)
- roll_2 = 7/6 + 35/36(roll_1)
Combine previous combined equation 2/3 and equation 1
- roll_1 = 6 + 7/6 + 35/36(roll_1)
- roll_1 = 43/6 + 35/36(roll_1)
- 1/36(roll_1) * 36 = 43/6 * 36
- roll_1 = 1548/6
- roll_1 = 258 rolls
