C Programming for Everybody - LBS290-13: Calculate Pay

Question:
This program will read an un-specified number of employee time records from input. 
Each time record will contain an employee number (integer), an employee rate per hour (float) and number of hours worked. 
You should give the employee time-and-a-half for overtime (hours over 40). 
You must write a function named calcpay() to calculate the pay. 
The function should have no return value and must not use any global variables. 
The calculated pay should be passed out of the function using call by location.

Python Code:
N/A

C Code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int empno;
    float rate, hours, pay;
    void calcpay();

    while(1) {
        if ( scanf("%d %f %f",&empno,&rate,&hours) < 3 ) {
            break;
        }

        calcpay(&pay, rate, hours);

        printf("Employee=%d Rate=%.2f Hours=%.2f Pay=%.2f\n", empno, rate, hours, pay);
    } 
}

void calcpay(p,r,h)
    /* declare pointer pay, rate and hour as float variables */
    float *p,r,h; 
{
    /* if hours > 40, calculate pay for first 40 hours using rate 
    and add the calculated overtime pay for hours over 40. */
    if ( h > 40.0 ) { 
       *p = r * 40.0 + (1.5 * r * (h - 40.0));
    }
    /* pay pointer = rate x hours */
    else {
       *p = r * h;
    }
}

Input:
123 5.00 40
100 4.00 45
199 5.25 10

Output:
Employee=123 Rate=5.00 Hours=40.00 Pay=200.00
Employee=100 Rate=4.00 Hours=45.00 Pay=190.00
Employee=199 Rate=5.25 Hours=10.00 Pay=52.50

Notes:
- This question required creating a function that uses pointers to the address that was provided in the main 
  program. The main equation I used was pointer pay = rate x hour to determine the employee pay. An if 
  statement was applied to create the special condition of overtime pay that is time and a half for hours 
  over 40. Parentheses were used to calculate the overtime pay where overtime pay = 1.5 * rate * (hour – 40.0).
  This calculation was added to the first calculated 40 hours for regular pay which was regular = rate * 40.0.  For the else statement, I placed the main equation pointer pay = rate x hour for all other conditions.  
- In modern C the correct way to declare variables is in the function.  
  Ex. 
      void calcpay(float *p, float r, float h)

C Programming for Everybody - Exercise RS-10: Concatenate Two Strings

Question:
Write a C program to prompt for two strings and concatenate them as shown in in the Python code below. 
Use the functions strcpy and strcat from the string.h library in your code. 
Pre-allocate your character arrays large enought to handle up to 100 characters on input for each string (i.e. do not use malloc as we have not yet covered that yet).

Python Code:
print('Enter two strings');
first = input()
second = input()
print(first + " & " + second)

C Code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_SIZE 100 /* define max size as 100 */

int main() {
    char dest[MAX_SIZE]; /* declare variables as characters with max_size */
    char first[MAX_SIZE];
    char second[MAX_SIZE];
  
    printf("Enter two strings\n"); /* print "Enter two strings" with new line */
  
    scanf("%99s", first); /* input first string with limit of 99 characters */
    scanf("%99s", second); /* input second string with limit of 99 characters */
  
    strcpy(dest, first); /* copy first string to destination variable */
    strcat(dest, " & "); /* concatenate destination variable with " & " */
    strcat(dest, second); /* concatenate second string to destination variable */
  
    printf("%s", dest); /* print first + " & " + second */
}

Input:
Kernighan
Ritchie

Output:
Enter two strings
Kernighan & Ritchie

Notes:
- Initially I solved the problem without using strcpy() and strcat(). I simply used scanf() to assign the 
  inputs to first and second variables. Then used the printf() statement to print out the desired output. 
  I couldn’t quite understand how strcpy() and strcat() functions worked with pointers but they already 
  contain pointers in the functions apparently. 
- My second iteration I decided to assign the results of each step to a variable called dest for destination.
  It was much easier to define the max size at the top using #define then placing that same constant in the 
  declarations for each variable. The scanf() function was used to limit inputs to 99 characters to prevent 
  buffer overflow. The strcpy() function requires a destination and source so I used the dest variable and
  the first variable string to copy the first string to assign a string to the destination. The strcat() also
  requires a destination and source. I used the dest variable once again and concatenated a “ & “ as the 
  prompt required. Then the dest variable was concatenated another time with the second variable string. 
  Lastly the dest variable was printed after all the steps using printf(). 
- scanf() function has potential overflow problems, better to use fgets() and remove the '\n' then sscanf().

C Programming for Everybody - Exercise RS-11: Write a function like Python rstrip()

Question:
Write a C function called py_rstrip() that removes spaces from the end of a string. 
This function modifies its parameter and should never be called with a constant value.

Python Code:
N/A

C Code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char s1[] = "   Hello   World    ";
    void py_rstrip();

    py_rstrip(s1);
    printf("-%s-\n", s1);
}

void py_rstrip(char inp[]) /* declare type and variable in function */
{
    int len; /* Declare len variable as int */
    len = strlen(inp); /* Find the length of input and assign to len variable */
  
    while (len > 0 && inp[len-1] == ' ') { 
        len -= 1; /* For blank space, decrement by 1, move from right to left */
    }
  
    inp[len] = '\0'; /* Places the null terminator to end the string */
}

Input:
N/A

Output:
-   Hello   World-

Notes:
- Earlier I was trying to figure out how to remove the new line /n from fgets() function. Looking through 
  some code, I had saw that it could be used to solve the rstrip() function problem.
- An index starting from the right could be done by using the strlen() function to find the length of the 
  inputted string. At first, I had tried using an if statement and for loop to try to decrement the index each.
  time a white space was found. It did not work as well as a while loop. The len > 0 was a good idea for a 
  safety check in the sense that the string could create an error. I decided to use len -= 1 to decrement 
  rather than –-len since that seemed a bit less intuitive for me. Placing a null terminator to the end of the
  string ‘\0’ was important since I had removed it initially using len-1. So, assigning inp[len] = ‘\0’ at the 
  end of the while loop makes sense to end the rstrip(). 
- Remember to declare variables within the function for modern C and assign length of strings to an int and 
  not a char data type.
