Question:
Teams Power Users - Microsoft SQL Interview Question
Write a query to identify the top 2 Power Users who sent the highest number of messages on Microsoft Teams in August 2022. Display the IDs of these 2 users along with the total number of messages they sent. Output the results in descending order based on the count of the messages.
Assumption:
No two users have sent the same number of messages in August 2022.

Data Dictionary:
Table name = 'messages'
message_id: integer
sender_id: integer
receiver_id: integer
content: varchar
sent_date: datetime

Code:
Solution #1 (mine)
SELECT
    sender_id,
    COUNT(message_id) AS message_count
FROM messages
WHERE sent_date BETWEEN '2022-08-01' AND '2022-08-31'
GROUP BY sender_id
HAVING COUNT(message_id) >= 2
ORDER BY message_count DESC
;

Solution #2
SELECT 
    sender_id,
    COUNT(message_id) AS message_count
FROM messages
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sent_date) = '8'
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) = '2022'
GROUP BY sender_id
ORDER BY message_count DESC
LIMIT 2
;

Solution #3
SELECT 
    sender_id,
    COUNT(message_id) as count_messages
FROM messages
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) = '2022'
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sent_date) = '8'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 2
;

Solution #4
SELECT 
    sender_id,
    COUNT(message_id) as count_messages
FROM messages
WHERE DATE_PART('year', sent_date) = '2022'
    AND DATE_PART('month', sent_date) = '8'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 2

Question:
4 Rolls To 4 - Visa Statistics Interview Question
A fair die is rolled repeatedly until a number larger than 4 is observed.
What's the probability that it takes you 4 rolls to roll a number greater than 4?

Data Dictionary:
Table name = ''
N/A

Code:
Desired outcome = # > 4
Number of sides = 6
Number of rolls = 4
Number of possible outcomes = 6^4 = 1296
- 1/6 chance for any side of the die
- 2/6 = 1/3 chance for number > 4
- 4/6 = 2/3 chance for number =< 4
Probability(P) = roll_1 * roll_2 * roll_3 * roll_4
P = 2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 1/3 = 8/81
