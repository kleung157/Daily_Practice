Question:
Signup Activation Rate - TikTok SQL Interview Question
New TikTok users sign up with their emails. 
They confirmed their signup by replying to the text confirmation to activate their accounts. 
Users may receive multiple text messages for account confirmation until they have confirmed their new account.
A senior analyst is interested to know the activation rate of specified users in the emails table. 
Write a query to find the activation rate. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places.
Definitions:
emails table contain the information of user signup details.
texts table contains the users' activation information.
Assumptions:
The analyst is interested in the activation rate of specific users in the emails table, which may not include all users that could potentially be found in the texts table.
For example, user 123 in the emails table may not be in the texts table and vice versa.
Explanation:
67% of users have successfully completed their signup and activated their accounts. 
The remaining 33% have not yet replied to the text to confirm their signup.

Data Dictionary:
Table name = 'emails'
email_id: integer(int)
user_id: intger(int)
signup_date: datetime(dt)
Table name = 'texts'
text_id: integer(int)
email_id: integer(int)
signup_action: varchar(str)

Code:
Solution #1
/* SELECT to preview data */
SELECT * FROM emails;
SELECT * FROM texts;

/* JOIN tables */
SELECT 
    e.email_id,
    e.user_id,
    t.signup_action,
    t.text_id
FROM emails as e
LEFT JOIN texts AS t
    ON e.email_id = t.email_id

/* Users sign up with emails, confirm signup by replying to text confirmation to 
activate their accounts. */
/* Users may recieve multiple text messages for account confirmation until they 
confirm their new account */
/* Activation rate of specified user in the emails table. */
/* Activation rate of specific users in emails table, may not include all users
that could be found in the texts table */
/* Output: confirm_rate, round percentage to 2 decimal */

/* Iter 1 */
SELECT 
    COUNT(t.signup_action),
    COUNT(signup_action) FILTER (WHERE signup_action = 'Confirmed'),
    COUNT(signup_action) FILTER (WHERE signup_action = 'Not Confirmed'),
    COUNT(signup_action) FILTER (WHERE signup_action ISNULL)
FROM emails AS e
LEFT JOIN texts AS t
    ON e.email_id = t.email_id;
    
/* Iter 2 */
SELECT 
    COUNT(user_id),
    COUNT(user_id) FILTER (WHERE signup_action = 'Confirmed'),
    COUNT(user_id) FILTER (WHERE signup_action = 'Not Confirmed'),
    COUNT(user_id) FILTER (WHERE signup_action ISNULL)
FROM emails as e
LEFT JOIN texts AS t
    ON e.email_id = t.email_id;

/* Iter 3 */
SELECT
    COUNT(user_id),
    COUNT(user_id) FILTER (WHERE signup_action = 'Confirmed'),
    COUNT(user_id) FILTER (WHERE signup_action = 'Not Confirmed' OR signup_action IS NULL)
FROM emails AS e
LEFT JOIN texts AS t
    ON e.email_id = t.email_id;;

/* Iter 4 */
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        COUNT(user_id) FILTER (WHERE signup_action = 'Confirmed')::DECIMAL /
        COUNT(user_id)
        , 2) AS activation_rate
FROM emails as e
LEFT JOIN texts AS t
    ON e.email_id = t.email_id;

/* Final iteration */
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) FILTER (WHERE t.signup_action = 'Confirmed')::DECIMAL /
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id)
        , 2) AS activation_rate
FROM emails as e
LEFT JOIN texts AS t
    ON e.email_id = t.email_id;

Solution #2 (better performance)
SELECT
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT texts.email_id)::DECIMAL / COUNT(DISTINCT emails.email_id), 2) AS activation_rate
FROM emails
LEFT JOIN texts
    ON emails.email_id = texts.email_id
    AND texts.signup_action = 'Confirmed';
